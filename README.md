## About

L'harmonie est numérique (harmony is digital) is a program that lets you play pieces of music with a cool display of the notes that are played.

The program also lets you generate new pieces of music using the Markov chain algorithm and manipulate existing tracks.

## Features

This programs lets you generate new pieces of music usign the Markov chain algorithm. To do this, select one or multiple tracks you'd like the new track to be inspired by, and click Generate.

You can also combine tracks, transpose (shift all notes up or down) and invert them (e.g. high notes become low notes...).
